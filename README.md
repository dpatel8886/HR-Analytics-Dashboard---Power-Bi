# HR-Analytics-Dashboard---Power-Bi
**Project Overview:** 

In this dynamic project, I was tasked by the HR manager to analyze attendance data spanning three months of 2022, provided in Excel sheets, to derive actionable insights. As a data analyst, understanding and interpreting the requirements was paramount. The HR manager's key questions included:

- What are the preferences for WFH versus WFO among employees?
- What is the percentage of sick leave taken, to monitor employee wellness?
- What percentage of employees are present during a given week or month?
- Which day of the week sees the highest attendance, to plan events effectively?
- What is the pattern of sick leave, to anticipate potential outbreaks and take preventive measures?

To meet these requirements, I executed the following steps:

1. **Data Cleaning and Transformation:** I utilized Power Query Editor to merge data from multiple sheets with varying column names, standardized date formats, and created custom columns for further analysis.
2. **KPI Development:** I developed key performance indicators, such as Presence %, WFH %, and SL %, using various formulas.
3. **Formulas Applied:** I frequently used formulas like SWITCH, DIVIDE, CALCULATE, and SUM to generate precise measures.
4. **Chart Creation:** I employed area charts and trend lines to visualize insights clearly and effectively.

**Key Insights Drawn:**

- A declining Presence % by month, potentially due to the summer season.
- An increasing trend in WFH %.
- A slight increase in SL %.
- A preference for WFH on Fridays among most employees.
- Monday shows the highest attendance, making it an ideal day for event planning.
